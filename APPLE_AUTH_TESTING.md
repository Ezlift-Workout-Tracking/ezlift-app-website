# Apple Authentication Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Apple Sign-in Button Missing from Signup Page
- **Problem**: The signup page only had Google sign-in, missing Apple sign-in option
- **Solution**: Added Apple sign-in button with consistent styling and functionality
- **Files Modified**: `components/auth/SignupForm.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Apple Login Popup Closing and Redirect Issues
- **Problem**: Apple login popup was closing unexpectedly and not redirecting properly
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling, improved fallback logic, and added better logging
- **Files Modified**: `lib/auth/signInWithApple.ts`

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Firebase Apple Sign-in is enabled in Firebase Console
2. Verify your domain is added to authorized domains in Firebase
3. Make sure all Firebase environment variables are set in `.env.local`

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Apple Sign-in on Login Page
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Click "Sign in with Apple" (black button)
3. **Expected Behaviors**:
   - Popup opens with Apple authentication
   - If popup is blocked, should automatically fallback to redirect
   - On success, should redirect to `/app` with welcome toast
   - Console should show logs for debugging

#### 2. Apple Sign-up on Signup Page
1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Click "Sign up with Apple" (black button at top)
3. **Expected Behaviors**:
   - Same popup/redirect flow as login
   - On success, should create account and redirect to `/app`
   - Should show "Welcome to EZLift!" toast

#### 3. Error Handling Tests

##### Account Already Exists
1. Try to sign up with Apple using an email already registered with Google/Email
2. **Expected**: Should show helpful message about signing in with existing provider first

##### Popup Blocked
1. Block popups in browser settings
2. Try Apple sign-in
3. **Expected**: Should automatically fallback to redirect flow with console log

##### User Cancels
1. Click Apple sign-in button
2. Cancel the Apple authentication popup
3. **Expected**: Should show "Sign-in was cancelled" message

### Debug Information

#### Console Logs to Watch For
- `Apple sign-in popup error:` - Shows any popup errors
- `Falling back to redirect for Apple sign-in` - Confirms redirect fallback
- `Apple redirect completed successfully:` - Confirms successful redirect completion

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Popup immediately closes**
   - Check if domain is authorized in Firebase Console
   - Verify Apple Sign-in is enabled in Firebase Authentication
   - Check browser console for CORS or domain errors

2. **Redirect doesn't complete**
   - Ensure `completeAppleRedirect()` is being called in useEffect
   - Check network tab for session API call failures
   - Verify backend `/api/auth/session` endpoint is working

3. **"Account exists" errors**
   - This is expected behavior for email conflicts
   - Users should sign in with their original provider first
   - Account linking can be implemented later in profile settings

### Browser Testing Matrix

| Browser | Desktop | Mobile | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Chrome | ✅ Popup | ✅ Redirect | Best support |
| Firefox | ✅ Popup | ✅ Redirect | Good support |
| Safari | ⚠️ Redirect | ✅ Redirect | Prefers redirect |
| Edge | ✅ Popup | ✅ Redirect | Good support |

### Production Considerations

1. **HTTPS Required**: Apple Sign-in requires HTTPS in production
2. **Domain Configuration**: Ensure production domain is added to Firebase authorized domains
3. **Apple Developer Setup**: Verify Apple Developer account configuration matches Firebase settings
