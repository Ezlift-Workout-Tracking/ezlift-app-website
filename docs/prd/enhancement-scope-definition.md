## Enhancement Description
Build the secure web app MVP from the current post-login placeholder into a meaningful dashboard-first experience. The web app will stand on its own (not mirroring mobile), reuse existing backend APIs, and serve as the primary surface to trial new features. Public-facing website revamp is explicitly out of scope for this PRD iteration and will be handled separately.
